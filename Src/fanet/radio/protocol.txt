			3: reserved
5bit		Cast:
			0: Broadcast (default)

Tracking (Type = 1)

[Byte 0-1]	Position	(Little Endian, 2-Complement)
bit 0-15	Latitude
[Byte 2-3]	Position	(Little Endian, 2-Complement)
bit 0-15	Longitude
			
			Detail:
			bit 15		even 0 odd 1 degree
			ddeg = (signed 15bit) * value / 2^15
			if(round(my_deg) is equal to bit15)
				deg = round(my_deg) + ddeg
			else
				find minimum of |round(my_deg)-1 + ddeg - my_lat| and |round(my_lat1)+1 + ddeg - my_lat| 
			
			(Max allowed distance 1deg -> approx. 111km latitude or longitude@latitude=equator,
			longitude@latitude=60deg: 55km, longitude@latitude=70deg: 38km (critical)) 
			(Max error <2m)
			(Note: longitude block-bit could be extended by a further bit in case of lat > +/-60deg, future work...)

[Byte 0]	Header
bit 0-7 	Subheader, Subtype (TBD)
			0: Normal Message

Service (Type = 4)

[Byte 0]	Header	(additional payload will be added in order 6 to 1, followed by Extended Header 7 to 0)
bit 7		Internet Gateway (no additional payload)

bit 1-4		TBD
bit 0		Extended Header (+1byte) (TBD, it may indicate the number of available landmarks) 
			The following is only mandatory if additional data will be added. Broadcasting the only the gateway flag doesn't require pos information.

[Byte 0]
bit 7		TBD
bit 4-6		Number of landmark feature (Required to replace old one. As e.g. the wind changed a feature may also change.)

//todo address detection, etc...
//todo: as a base station is in rage, do not forward tracking info. only forward tracking info if very little traffic is present...
//todo: forward bit for type 1 should only be set it no inet gateway in in close range

Notes:
------
Version number:
We omitted a bit field that shows the protocol version as this would take to much space. The app layer should provide this, if required. (Todo)

Device ID:
-For unregistered Devices/Manufacturers: Set the Manufacturer to 0xFC or 0xFD and choose a random ID between 0x0001 and 0xFFFE. 
List on the channel if the id is already used.
-0xFE shall be used for multicast (E.g. competition/group messaging).
-The manufacturers 0x00 and 0xFF as well as the IDs 0x0000 and 0xFFFF are reserved.


Manufacturer IDs:
0x00		[reserved]
0x01		Skytraxx
