Landmarks (Type = 5) (under development)
Note: Landmarks are completely independent. Thus the first coordinate in each packet has to be an absolute one. All others are in relation to this and therefore compressed. 
Note2: Identification/detection shall be done by hashing the whole payload, excluding bytes 0, 1 and, 2 (optional). That way one quietly can change the layer to 'Don't care' and quickly 
	destroy the landmark w/o having to wait for it's relative live span to be exceeded. 
Note3: In case a text has the same postion as the first position of any other landmark form then the text is considered to be the form's label.

Remote Configuration (Type = 6)		NOTE: Do not use, in development!
Note 1: Signature (symmetric) is highly recommended
Note 2: In order to indicate a successful configuration the receiver shall transmit the configured feature instantaneously.
Note 3: Each reply feature with a suitable mask shall be played using round robin w/ 20sec intervals followed by a 3min pause.
Note 4: Skytraxx 3.0 silently assumes that Remote Configuration is available is if a Service from the same address is present.

Coordinate Formats

[Byte 0-1]	Position	(Little Endian, 2-Complement)
bit 0-15	Latitude
[Byte 2-3]	Position	(Little Endian, 2-Complement)
bit 0-15	Longitude

			Details:
			bit 15		even 0 odd 1 degree
			ddeg = (signed 15bit) * value / 2^15
			if(round(my_deg) is equal to bit15)
				deg = round(my_deg) + ddeg
			else
				find minimum of |round(my_deg)-1 + ddeg - my_lat| and |round(my_lat1)+1 + ddeg - my_lat| 
			
			(Max allowed distance 1deg -> approx. 111km latitude or longitude@latitude=equator,
			longitude@latitude=60deg: 55km, longitude@latitude=70deg: 38km (critical)) 
			(Max error <2m)
			(Note: longitude block-bit could be extended by a further bit in case of lat > +/-60deg, future work...)
			
Sample C code for decompressing:
float fns_buf2coord_compressed(uint16_t *buf, float mycoord)
{
	/* decode buffer */
	bool odd = !!((1<<15) & *buf);
	int16_t sub_deg_int = (*buf&0x7FFF) | (1<<14&*buf)<<1;
	const float sub_deg = sub_deg_int / 32767.0f;


	/* retrieve coordinate */
	float mycood_rounded = roundf(mycoord);
	bool mycoord_isodd = ((int)mycood_rounded) & 1;

	/* target outside our segment. estimate where it is in */
	if(mycoord_isodd != odd)
	{
		/* adjust deg segment */
		const float mysub_deg = mycoord - mycood_rounded;
		if(sub_deg > mysub_deg)
			mycood_rounded--;
		else
			mycood_rounded++;
	}

	return mycood_rounded + sub_deg;
}

Sample C code for compressing (note: byte order in stream is low to high):
uint16_t fns_coord2buf_compressed(float ref_deg)
{
	const float deg_round = roundf(ref_deg);
	const bool deg_odd = ((int)deg_round) & 1;
	const float decimal = ref_deg - deg_round;
	int dec_int = (int)(decimal*32767.0f);
	clamp(dec_int, -16383, 16383);

	return ((dec_int&0x7FFF) | (!!deg_odd<<15));

Absolute:
[Byte 0-2]	Position	(Little Endian, 2-Complement)
bit 0-23	Latitude
[Byte 3-5]	Position	(Little Endian, 2-Complement)

			Details:
			Latitude = value_lat/93206	\in [-90, +90]
			Longitude = value_lon/46603 \in [-180, +180]
			(Note: 32bit floating point is required for direct conversion)


------------

Signature (symmetric)

Use SHA1 and iterate over pseudo header (first 4 byte:  type + source address, were bits 6 and 7 of byte 0 are set to 0), over the payload, and over a pre-shared secret/key.
The first 4 byte of the resulting hash shall be interpreted as 32bit integer and put into the signature field (= normal order due to little endian encoding).

------------

//todo address detection, etc...
//todo: as a base station is in rage, do not forward tracking info. only forward tracking info if very little traffic is present...
//todo: forward bit for type 1 should only be set it no inet gateway in in close range

Notes:
------
Version number:
We omitted a bit field that shows the protocol version as this would take to much space. The app layer should provide this, if required. (Todo)

Device ID:
-For unregistered Devices/Manufacturers: Set the Manufacturer to 0xFC or 0xFD and choose a random ID between 0x0001 and 0xFFFE. 
List on the channel if the id is already used.
-0xFE shall be used for multicast (E.g. competition/group messaging).
-The manufacturers 0x00 and 0xFF as well as the IDs 0x0000 and 0xFFFF are reserved.
