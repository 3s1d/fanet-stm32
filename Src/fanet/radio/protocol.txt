Header:

Source Address:
[Byte 1-3]
1byte		Manufacturer
2byte		Unique ID (Little Endian)
 
Extended Header:
[Byte 4 (if Extended Header bit is set)]
7-6bit 		ACK:
			0: none (default)
			1: requested
			2: requested (via forward, if received via forward (received forward bit = 0). must be used if forward is set)
			3: reserved
5bit		Cast:
			0: Broadcast (default)
			1: Unicast (adds destination address (8+16bit)) (should only be forwarded if dest addr in cache and no 'better' retransmission heard so far)
4bit 		Signature (if 1, add 4byte)
3-0bit 		Reserved	(ideas: indicate multicast interest add 16bit addr, emergency)

Destination Address (if unicast is set):
[Byte 5-7]
1byte		Manufacturer

Signature (if signature bit is set):
[Byte 5-8 or Byte 8-11 (if unicast is set)]

Coordinate Formats

Compressed (reference coordinate required):
[Byte 0-1]	Position	(Little Endian, 2-Complement)
bit 0-15	Latitude
[Byte 2-3]	Position	(Little Endian, 2-Complement)
bit 0-15	Longitude

			Details:
			bit 15		even 0 odd 1 degree
			ddeg = (signed 15bit) * value / 2^15
			if(round(my_deg) is equal to bit15)
				deg = round(my_deg) + ddeg
			else
				find minimum of |round(my_deg)-1 + ddeg - my_lat| and |round(my_lat1)+1 + ddeg - my_lat| 
			
			(Max allowed distance 1deg -> approx. 111km latitude or longitude@latitude=equator,
			longitude@latitude=60deg: 55km, longitude@latitude=70deg: 38km (critical)) 
			(Max error <2m)
			(Note: longitude block-bit could be extended by a further bit in case of lat > +/-60deg, future work...)

Absolute:
[Byte 0-2]	Position	(Little Endian, 2-Complement)
bit 0-23	Latitude
[Byte 3-5]	Position	(Little Endian, 2-Complement)
bit 0-23	Longitude

			Details:
			Latitude = value_lat/93206	\in [-90, +90]
			Longitude = value_lon/46603 \in [-180, +180]
			(Note: 32bit floating point is required for direkt conversion)

//todo address detection, etc...
//todo: as a base station is in rage, do not forward tracking info. only forward tracking info if very little traffic is present...
//todo: forward bit for type 1 should only be set it no inet gateway in in close range

Notes:
------
Version number:
We omitted a bit field that shows the protocol version as this would take to much space. The app layer should provide this, if required. (Todo)

Device ID:
-For unregistered Devices/Manufacturers: Set the Manufacturer to 0xFC or 0xFD and choose a random ID between 0x0001 and 0xFFFE. 
List on the channel if the id is already used.
-0xFE shall be used for multicast (E.g. competition/group messaging).
-The manufacturers 0x00 and 0xFF as well as the IDs 0x0000 and 0xFFFF are reserved.


Manufacturer IDs:
